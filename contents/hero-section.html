        <p>Web Developer & UI/UX Designer</p>
        <p>Chocola’s twin sister and the youngest among the Minaduki catgirls. 
            I am prone to be misunderstood because i rarely expresses her emotions. 
            In fact, i am quite smart and often makes some remarkable insights. 
            My sharp wit and I’ll-do-things-my-way attitude make me standout. 
            However, i remains both kind-hearted and, well, catlike.</p>
